# webpack-sass-lifter-loader
A Webpack loader and plugin that recursively lifts sass dependencies into the entry point. 

Work in progress, not complete yet, but I'm able to log out the result of the plugin.  

All that I want to do now is either return the value of the css output to the loader, so it can be exported as a string, or pitched to the raw loader.

If you run the example, you'll see the string output in the console, but I need to get this string into the FrontPage.jsx module (where the dependencies start)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
